### My Course Notes
- all Ruby files should end in .rb
- running files in CLI start with ruby, e.g. ruby puts_command.rb
- comments start with #
- Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB), interactive shell that can be used in CLI, activated with irb in CLI or irb --simple-prompt for simplified version, quit exits shell
- help/info can be found via ri command e.g. ri String, useful when offline
