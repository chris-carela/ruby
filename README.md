### **_My Course Notes_**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language
- objects can be abstracted, have attributes, instance of a class
- variables are not objects but store a reference to an object and have a value (e.g. `first_name = "Kevin"`)
- all Ruby files should end in `.rb`
- running files in CLI start with ruby, e.g. `ruby puts_command.rb`
- comments start with `#`
- Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB), interactive shell that can be used in CLI, activated with `irb` in CLI or `irb --simple-prompt` for simplified version, `quit` exits shell
- help/info can be found via `ri` command e.g. `ri String, useful when offline`
